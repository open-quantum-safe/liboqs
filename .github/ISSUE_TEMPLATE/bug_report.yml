        Thank you for submitting a bug report to liboqs. Before submitting, we
        encourage you to search through the following resources:

        - [issues](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues) 

        - [pull requests](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls)


        If this is a question regarding usage rather than a bug in the software,
        the best place for that is our Github [discussion
        forum](https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions).
