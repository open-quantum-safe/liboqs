# Trigger oqs-provider release tests.
# Runs whenever a release is published, or when a commit message ends with "[trigger downstream]"
# When triggered by a release, the liboqs release tag and the provider "<release tag>-tracker" branch are used.
# When triggered by a commit message, the triggering liboqs branch and the provider "<liboqs branch>-tracker" branch are used.
# If the tracker branch does not exist, the downstream pipeline should detect it and run on the main branch instead.
