liboqs version 0.12.0-rc1
=========================

About
-----

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.

liboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:

- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key authentication and exchange for TLS 1.3, X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.
- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.
- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.

Several [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.

liboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:

- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp
- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go
- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java
- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python
- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust

Release notes
=============

This is release candidate 1 for version 0.12.0 of liboqs. It was released on November 29, 2024.

This release updates the ML-DSA implementation to the [final FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final) version. This release still includes the NIST Round 3 version of Dilithium for interoperability purposes, but we plan to remove Dilithium Round 3 in a future release.

Deprecation notice
==================

This will be the last release of liboqs to include Kyber (that is, the NIST Round 3 version of Kyber, prior to its standardization by NIST as ML-KEM in FIPS 203). Applications should switch to ML-KEM (FIPS 203).

The addition of ML-DSA FIPS 204 final version to liboqs has introduced a new signature API which includes a context string parameter. We are planning to remove the old version of the API without a context string in the next release to streamline the API and bring it in line with NIST specifications. Users who have an opinion on this removal are invited to provide input at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/2001.

What's New
----------

This release continues from the 0.11.0 release of liboqs.

### Key encapsulation mechanisms

- HQC: Fixed correctness bug in decapsulation. Thank you to Célian Glénaz and Dahmun Goudarzi from Quarkslab for identifying the issue.
- Kyber: This is the last release of liboqs to include Kyber.
- ML-KEM: Improved testing of ML-KEM.

### Digital signature schemes

- LMS: Fixed crashing bug.
- ML-DSA: Removed FIPS 204-ipd (initial public draft) and replaced it with FIPS 204 final version.
- Added new API for digital signatures with context strings; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/2001 for plan to remove old API without context string.
- Added fuzzing tests for signature schemes.
- Added benchmarking for stateful hash-based signature schemes.

### Other changes

- Updated CBOM format to version 1.6.
- Added a function `OQS_thread_stop` to be called by multi-threaded applications to properly deallocate resources in a threaded execution.
- Added preprocessor macros conveying liboqs version information.
