liboqs version 0.13.0
=====================

About
-----

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.

liboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:

- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key authentication and exchange for TLS 1.3, X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.
- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.
- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.

Several [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.

liboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:

- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp
- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go
- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java
- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python
- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust

Release notes
=============

This is version 0.13.0 of liboqs. It was released on April 02, 2025.

This release improves support for NIST Additional Signatures Round 2 candidates: CROSS and MAYO implementations are updated and support is added for UOV. This release also adds a new KEM API for deterministic key generation (only supported by ML-KEM at the moment). Finally, this release adds support for ML-KEM implementations from 2 new sources: formally verified portable C, AVX2, and AArch64 implementations from [PQCP's mlkem-native](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native) and a GPU accelerated CUDA implementation from [Nvidia cuPQC](https://developer.nvidia.com/cupqc). 

OQS is running a survey to better understand our community. We would like to hear from organizations and individuals about their interest in and use of the Open Quantum Safe project. Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey: https://linuxfoundation.surveymonkey.com/r/oqssurvey

What's New
----------

This release continues from the 0.12.0 release of liboqs.

### Key encapsulation mechanisms

- New API: Added a deterministic key generation and API for KEMs (only ML-KEM supported at the moment).
- ML-KEM: Changed the default ML-KEM implementation to [PQCP's mlkem-native](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native). There are three variants: Portable C, AVX2, and AArch64. Large parts of these implementations are formally verified: all of the C code is verified for memory and type safety using [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) and the functional correctness of the core AArch64 assembly routines is verified using [HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light). 
- ML-KEM: Added support for the ML-KEM implementation from [Nvidia cuPQC](https://developer.nvidia.com/cupqc), a GPU accelerated cryptography library.
- ML-KEM: Implementation from mlkem-native upstream updated to add Pair-wise Consistency Test (PCT) and Intel CET support.
- ML-KEM: Improved testing of ML-KEM keys.

### Digital signature schemes

- ML-DSA: Improved testing for ML-DSA.
- CROSS: Updated to NIST Additional Signatures Round 2 version.
- MAYO: Updated to NIST Additional Signatures Round 2 version.
- UOV: Added support for UOV algorithm from NIST Additional Signatures Round 2.

### Other changes

- Added support for loongarch64 architecture.
