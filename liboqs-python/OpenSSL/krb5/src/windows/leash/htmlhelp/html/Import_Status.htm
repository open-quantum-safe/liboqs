<h1>Import Status </h1>
<p>
The Import Status column in the main window shows whether tickets were
obtained with the Get Ticket function in MIT Kerberos or if they were
obtained by a Windows Logon session when you logged on to a domain, and
whether they have been imported or exported to the other application. </p>
<p>
To show or hide this column, open the Options tab and use the Import
Status checkbox in the View Options panel. Note that Import Status is
only available if you have obtained tickets through a Windows Logon
session. <br>

<td>The tickets were obtained when you started a Windows Logon session  by logging in to a domain.
<p></p>
They have not been imported into Windows for Kerberos because User
Access Control (UAC) in Windows is preventing that action. If you want
to allow the tickets to be imported, turn off your computer's UAC. </td>

</tr><tr>
<th id="th2">exportable</th>
<td> You used the Get Ticket window to obtain these tickets.
<p></p>
They have not been exported.  <p></p>
To export these tickets for use with Windows services, click the Export
Ticket button. Note that exporting your tickets replaces rather than
adds to any existing tickets in your Windows Logon session. </td>

</tr><tr>
<th id="th2">exported</th>
<td>You used the Get Ticket window to obtain these tickets.
<p></p>
They have been exported into your Windows Logon session and can be used with Windows services. </td>
