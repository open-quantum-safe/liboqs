Use Leash?</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Leash is a graphical system-tray tool designed to
manage for
Kerberos tickets on Microsoft Windows. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Leash
is used to obtain Kerberos tickets,
change your Kerberos password, and obtain Andrew File System (AFS)
tokens.</p>
<p>Leash combines the functionality of several command line tools a
user would use to manage Kerberos functions: <a
 href="leash_external_kinit.htm">kinit</a>, <a
 href="leash_external_klist.htm">klist</a>, <a
 href="leash_external_kdestroy.htm">kdestroy</a>, ms2mit, aklog, and
passwd or kpasswd. Leash combines all of these functions into one user
interface and supports&nbsp; auto-renewal or <a
 href="leash_topic_leash_window.htm">user notification</a> when tickets
are approaching expiration.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many ways to execute Leash. In addition
to
clicking on a Leash shortcut, you can start Leash from the Windows
command
Prompt or Run... option. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Command-line
options may be specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you run Leash
with the options -i or -kinit, it will display the ticket
initialization dialog
and exit; -m or –ms2mit or –import will import tickets from the
Microsoft
Windows logon session (if available) and exit; -d or -destroy will
destroy all
existing tickets and exit; -r or –renew will renew existing Kerberos
tickets
(if possible) and exit; -a or –autoinit will display the ticket
initialization
dialog if you have no Kerberos tickets.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may create a shortcut to Leash within your
Windows
Startup folder (Start Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Startup).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A
shortcut to “Leash32.exe –autoinit” ensures that Kerberos tickets are
available
for the use of Kerberized applications throughout your Windows logon
session.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If Leash is not executed before using a Kerberized
application, the application may prompt you for your password. Some
applications, like lpr, never prompt you for a password. These
applications
simply terminate with a message indicating that you are not
authenticated. Before
these applications can successfully be used a separate program, such as
Leash
or kinit, must be used to first authenticate you using Kerberos.<b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Leash does not perform a logon in the sense of the
Windows
Logon Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A logon service would do
more than manage Kerberos tickets. A logon service would authenticate
you to
the local machine, validate access to your local file system and
performs
additional set-up tasks. These are beyond the scope of Leash. Leash
simply
allows you to manage Kerberos tickets on behalf of compatible
applications and
to change your Kerberos password. <o:p></o:p></p>
