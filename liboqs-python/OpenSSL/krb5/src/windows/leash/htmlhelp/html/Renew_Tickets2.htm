Renewing your tickets allows you to run batch jobs without interruption and to work through a long session without continually reentering your password. Each time you renew your ticket, Kerberos resets the ticket lifetime to the length of the orginal ticket. </p>

<li> Enter your user name and password in the Get Ticket window. If the advanced settings are not visible, click Show Advanced Settings. </li>
<li> Under "Flag this ticket as, " select <b>Renewable</b> if it is not already checked.
<li> Use the Renewable Until slider if you want to adjust how many days (or hours) you will be able to renew this ticket.</li>
<li> Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<H2>Renew ticket automatically</H2>
<p>To set your Kerberos tickets to automatically renew for the entire renewable lifetime of the tickets, click the <b> Options</b> drop down button and select <b>Automatic Ticket Renewal</b>. If this option is already checked, selecting it will uncheck it and turn automatic renewal off. </p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>MIT Kerberos can only automatically renew tickets while MIT Kerberos is active and running. This means that if your machine is in hibernation mode or if MIT Kerberos is not running when it is time to renew your tickets, your tickets will not be renewed. </p>
<p>
