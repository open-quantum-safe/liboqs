NAME
 kdestroy - destroy Kerberos tickets

SYNOPSIS
 kdestroy [-5] [-4] [-q] [-c cache_name]

DESCRIPTION

 The kdestroy utility destroys the user's active Kerberos
 authorization tickets by writing zeros to the specified credentials
 cache that contains them.  If the credentials cache is not specified,
 the default credentials cache is destroyed.  If kdestroy was built with
 Kerberos 4 support, the default behavior is to destroy both Kerberos 5
 and Kerberos 4 credentials.  Otherwise, kdestroy will default to
 destroying only Kerberos 5 credentials.

OPTIONS

 -5 destroy Kerberos 5 credentials.  This overrides whatever the
    default built-in behavior may be.  This option may be used with -4

 -4 destroy Kerberos 4 credentials.  This overrides whatever the
    default built-in behavior may be.  This option is only available
    if kinit was built with Kerberos 4 compatibility.  This option may
    be used with -5

 -q Run quietly.  Normally kdestroy beeps if it fails to destroy the
    user's tickets.  The -q flag suppresses this behavior.

 -c cache_name
    use cache_name as the credentials (ticket) cache name and
    location; if this option is not used, the default cache name and
    location are used.

 The default credentials cache may vary between systems.  If the
 KRB5CCNAME environment variable is set, its value is used to name the
 default ticket cache.

 Most installations recommend that you place the kdestroy command in
 your .logout file, so that your tickets are destroyed automatically
 when you log out.

ENVIRONMENT
 Kdestroy uses the following environment variables:

 KRB5CCNAME Location of the Kerberos 5 credentials (ticket) cache.

 KRBTKFILE Filename of the Kerberos 4 credentials (ticket) cache.

FILES
 /tmp/krb5cc_[uid] default location of Kerberos 5 credentials cache
 ([uid] is the decimal UID of the user).

 /tmp/tkt[uid] default location of Kerberos 4 credentials cache ([uid]
 is the decimal UID of the user).

SEE  ALSO
 kinit(1), klist(1), krb5(3)

BUGS
 Only the tickets in the specified credentials cache are
 destroyed.  Separate ticket caches are used to hold root instance and
 password changing tickets.  These should probably be destroyed too,
 or all of a user's tickets kept in a single credentials cache.</CODE></PRE>
