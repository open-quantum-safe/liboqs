<b>Note: </b>MIT Kerberos cannot permanently destroy tickets you've obtained by logging into a Windows domain, even if you've imported them. Those tickets are destroyed when you log out of the domain.</td>

Automatically renew tickets flagged as renewable, without promptings or requiring a password,  until the renewal lifetime is reached. </td>

<b>Note: </b>Automatic ticket renewal will not work if you exit MIT Kerberos or if your machine is in hibernation mode.
