<H1>Using the View  Panel </H1>
<p>
Use the View panel to choose which information columns are displayed in the main window. The View panel is to the right of the buttons in the top of the Kerberos window.</p>
<H3>Show or Hide View Columns</H3>
<p>
A checkmark next to a View option indicates that the View column is currently shown in the main window. For example, "Valid Until" is selected by default, so the main window shows the Valid Until column unless you unselect that checkbox. </p>

<H3>Viewing Ticket Information</H3>
<p>
The columns selected in the View panel show in the main window.
Click and drag the line separating two column headings to make a column wider or narrower. Click the blue triangle next to a principal to see information for all of the principal's tickets. <a href="HTML/View_Tickets.htm">More help about viewing tickets </a> </p>
