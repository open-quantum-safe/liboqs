The Kerberos v5 Properties dialog is accessible from the Options menu.
This dialog has two tabs: <span style="font-weight: bold;">File
Location</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration
Options</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">File Location:</span><br>

<br>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-indent: 0in;">The <b>File
Location</b>
tab allows you to specify the location of the default Kerberos 5 ticket
cache and
configuration file.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <b style="">Ticket
File </b>field specifies the name of
the in-memory cache (Ticket File) used to store the Kerberos 5 tickets.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The format of the name is “API:” followed by
the cache name or "MSLSA:".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disk caches
(type "FILE:") are not
supported by Kerberos for Windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <b
 style="">Configuration File </b>field specifies the
path to the Kerberos 5 configuration file, krb5.ini.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If <b style="">Confirm
that new configuration file exists</b> is checked when the
configuration file
location is changed, then Leash will not accept values which are not
pre-existing Kerberos 5 configuration files.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the <b style="">Configuration
Options</b> page, you provide default attribute values to be used when
requesting Kerberos 5 tickets from the Kerberos server.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When <b style="">Forwardable </b>tickets
are received from the Kerberos Server, these tickets can be forwarded
to a
remote host when you connect via telnet, ssh, ftp, rlogin, or similar
applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When tickets are
forwarded, there is no need to obtain Kerberos tickets again to access
Kerberized
services on the remote host. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When <b style="">Proxiable </b>tickets
are received from the Kerberos Server, these tickets can be passed onto
Kerberized services which can in turn act on your behalf.<span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When <b style="">Renewable</b>
tickets are received from the Kerberos Server, the ticket lifetimes may
be
renewed without prompting the user for her password.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This allows Kerberos tickets to be issued
with short lifetimes allowing compromised accounts to be disabled on
short
notice without requiring the user to enter a password every few hours.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When combined with <b style="">Automatic
Ticket Renewal </b>(Option menu), Leash can maintain valid
tickets for a week, a month, or longer by automatically renewing
tickets prior
to their expiration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ability to
renew tickets without a password is limited by the ticket’s renewable
lifetime as
issued by the Kerberos Server.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Traditionally, Kerberos tickets have included a
list of
network addresses within the tickets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This address list restricts the use of the tickets to the
computers
which are assigned those addresses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
use of address lists has become a headache for many users of Kerberos
on
network connections which use either Network Address Translation
(Cable/DSL
routers) or Network Address Hiding (VPN) capabilities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On these networks the address of the client
machine appears to be different to the network service than it does to
the
client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result is the Kerberos
ticket is deemed to be invalid by the service even though it has not been
stolen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <b style="">No Addresses </b>is
checked, Kerberos will not insert an address list
into the Kerberos tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
Kerberized services which do not require address lists, this will
enable
Kerberos to be used across NAT and VPN based connections.<span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note 1:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of
Kerberos 5 release 1.3, the library default is to disable the use of
address
lists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leash will detect the setting
from the Kerberos 5 configuration and check the <b style="">No
Addresses</b> box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you
attempt to re-enable address lists while the library is configured to
disable
them , Leash will warn you that the Kerberos 5 configuration file must
be
altered. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note 2: Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)
servers
require the use of address lists.</p>
