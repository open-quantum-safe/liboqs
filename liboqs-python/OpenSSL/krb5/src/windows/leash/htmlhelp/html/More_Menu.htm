Allow Mixed Case Realm Name</th>
<td>If your Kerberos realm name uses any lower case letters.</td>
<td>
<a name="mixed-case-realm">Kerberos <em>realms</em> are a way of logically grouping resources and identities that use Kerberos. </a> By convention, realm names use all upper case letters. This helps distinguish a realm from the DNS domain it corrosponds to. Realm names are case sensitive. So for convenience, anything you enter in the realm field of the Get Ticket window is converted to upper case, unless you turn this option on. </td></tr>
