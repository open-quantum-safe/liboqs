These macros are taken from the autoconf archive at
ac-archive.sourceforge.net.  Unless otherwise noted, they are under
this modified version of the GNU General Public License version 2
(also copied from ac-archive.sourceforge.net):

    Every Autoconf macro presented on this web site is free software;
    you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
    GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
    Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any later
    version.

    They are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but

    As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives
    unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure
    scripts that are the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the
    terms of the GNU General Public License when using or distributing
    such scripts, even though portions of the text of Autoconf appear
    in them. The GNU General Public License (GPL) does govern all
    other use of the material that constitutes the Autoconf program.

    Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be
    copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output
    of Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the
    Autoconf source text consists of comments plus executable code
    that decides which of the data portions to output in any given
    case. We call these comments and executable code the "non-data"
    portions. Autoconf never copies any of the non-data portions into
    its output.

    This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf
    released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and
    distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this
    special exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as
    well, *unless* your modified version has the potential to copy
    into its output some of the text that was the non-data portion of
    the version that you started with. (In other words, unless your
    change moves or copies text from the non-data portions to the data
    portions.) If your modification has such potential, you must
    delete any notice of this special exception to the GPL from your
    modified version.
