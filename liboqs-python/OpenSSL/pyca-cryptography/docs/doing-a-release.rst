Doing a release
===============

Doing a release of ``cryptography`` requires a few steps.

Security Releases
-----------------

In addition to the other steps described below, for a release which fixes a
security vulnerability, you should also include the following steps:

* Request a `CVE from MITRE`_. Once you have received the CVE, it should be
  included in the :doc:`changelog`. Ideally you should request the CVE before
  starting the release process so that the CVE is available at the time of the
  release.
* Ensure that the :doc:`changelog` entry credits whoever reported the issue.
* The release should be announced on the `oss-security`_ mailing list, in
  addition to the regular announcement lists.

Verifying OpenSSL version
-------------------------

The release process creates wheels bundling OpenSSL for Windows, macOS, and
Linux. Check that the Windows and macOS Jenkins builders have the latest
version of OpenSSL installed and verify that the latest version is present in
the ``pyca/cryptography-manylinux1`` docker containers. If anything is out
of date follow the instructions for upgrading OpenSSL.

Upgrading OpenSSL
-----------------

Use the `upgrading OpenSSL issue template`_.

Bumping the version number
--------------------------

The next step in doing a release is bumping the version number in the
software.

* Update the version number in ``src/cryptography/__about__.py``.
* Update the version number in ``vectors/cryptography_vectors/__about__.py``.
* Set the release date in the :doc:`/changelog`.
* Do a commit indicating this.
* Send a pull request with this.
* Wait for it to be merged.

Performing the release
----------------------

The commit that merged the version number bump is now the official release
commit for this release. You will need to have ``gpg`` installed and a ``gpg``
key in order to do a release. Once this has happened:

* Run ``python release.py {version}``.

The release should now be available on PyPI and a tag should be available in
the repository.

Verifying the release
---------------------

You should verify that ``pip install cryptography`` works correctly:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import cryptography
    >>> cryptography.__version__
    '...'
    >>> import cryptography_vectors
    >>> cryptography_vectors.__version__
    '...'

Verify that this is the version you just released.

For the Windows wheels check the builds for the ``cryptography-wheel-builder``
job and verify that the final output for each build shows it loaded and linked
the expected OpenSSL version.

Post-release tasks
------------------

* Update the version number to the next major (e.g. ``0.5.dev1``) in
  ``src/cryptography/__about__.py`` and
  ``vectors/cryptography_vectors/__about__.py``.
* Close the `milestone`_ for the previous release on GitHub.
* Add new :doc:`/changelog` entry with next version and note that it is under
  active development
* Send a pull request with these items
* Check for any outstanding code undergoing a deprecation cycle by looking in
  ``cryptography.utils`` for ``DeprecatedIn**`` definitions. If any exist open
  a ticket to increment them for the next release.
* Send an email to the `mailing list`_ and `python-announce`_ announcing the
  release.
