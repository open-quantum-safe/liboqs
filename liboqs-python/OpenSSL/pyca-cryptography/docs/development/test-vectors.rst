Test vectors
============

Testing the correctness of the primitives implemented in each ``cryptography``
backend requires trusted test vectors. Where possible these vectors are
obtained from official sources such as `NIST`_ or `IETF`_ RFCs. When this is
not possible ``cryptography`` has chosen to create a set of custom vectors
using an official vector file as input to verify consistency between
implemented backends.

Vectors are kept in the ``cryptography_vectors`` package rather than within our
main test suite.

Sources

Project Wycheproof
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We run vectors from `Project Wycheproof`_ -- a collection of known edge-cases
for various cryptographic algorithms. These are not included in the repository
(or ``cryptography_vectors`` package), but rather cloned from Git in our
continuous integration environments.

We have ensured all test vectors are used as of commit
``f89f4c53a8845fcefcdb9f14ee9191dbe167e3e3``.

Creating test vectors
---------------------

When official vectors are unavailable ``cryptography`` may choose to build
its own using existing vectors as source material.

Created Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    custom-vectors/arc4
    custom-vectors/cast5
    custom-vectors/idea
    custom-vectors/seed
    custom-vectors/hkdf


If official test vectors appear in the future the custom generated vectors
should be discarded.

Any vectors generated by this method must also be prefixed with the following
header format (substituting the correct information):

.. code-block:: python

    # CAST5 CBC vectors built for https://github.com/pyca/cryptography
    # Derived from the AESVS MMT test data for CBC
    # Verified against the CommonCrypto and Go crypto packages
    # Key Length : 128
