Key derivation functions
========================

.. module:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf

Key derivation functions derive bytes suitable for cryptographic operations
from passwords or other data sources using a pseudo-random function (PRF).
Different KDFs are suitable for different tasks such as:

* Cryptographic key derivation

    Deriving a key suitable for use as input to an encryption algorithm.
    Typically this means taking a password and running it through an algorithm
    such as :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2.PBKDF2HMAC` or
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf.HKDF`.
    This process is typically known as `key stretching`_.

* Password storage

    When storing passwords you want to use an algorithm that is computationally
    intensive. Legitimate users will only need to compute it once (for example,
    taking the user's password, running it through the KDF, then comparing it
    to the stored value), while attackers will need to do it billions of times.
    Ideal password storage KDFs will be demanding on both computational and
    memory resources.

.. currentmodule:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2

.. class:: PBKDF2HMAC(algorithm, length, salt, iterations, backend)

    .. versionadded:: 0.2

    `PBKDF2`_ (Password Based Key Derivation Function 2) is typically used for
    deriving a cryptographic key from a password. It may also be used for
    key storage, but an alternate key storage KDF such as
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.scrypt.Scrypt` is generally
    considered a better solution.

    This class conforms to the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.KeyDerivationFunction`
    interface.

    :param algorithm: An instance of
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.HashAlgorithm`.
    :param int length: The desired length of the derived key in bytes. Maximum
        is (2\ :sup:`32` - 1) * ``algorithm.digest_size``.
    :param bytes salt: A salt. Secure values [#nist]_ are 128-bits (16 bytes)
        or longer and randomly generated.
    :param int iterations: The number of iterations to perform of the hash
        function. This can be used to control the length of time the operation
        takes. Higher numbers help mitigate brute force attacks against derived
        keys. See OWASP's `Password Storage Cheat Sheet`_ for more
        detailed recommendations if you intend to use this for password storage.
    :param backend: An instance of
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.backends.interfaces.PBKDF2HMACBackend`.

    :raises cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm: This is raised if the
        provided ``backend`` does not implement
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.backends.interfaces.PBKDF2HMACBackend`

    :raises TypeError: This exception is raised if ``salt`` is not ``bytes``.

    .. method:: derive(key_material)

        :param bytes key_material: The input key material. For PBKDF2 this
            should be a password.
        :return bytes: the derived key.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized: This is raised when
                                                          :meth:`derive` or

        :raises TypeError: This exception is raised if ``key_material`` is not
                           ``bytes``.

        This generates and returns a new key from the supplied password.

    .. method:: verify(key_material, expected_key)

        :param bytes key_material: The input key material. This is the same as
                                   ``key_material`` in :meth:`derive`.
        :param bytes expected_key: The expected result of deriving a new key,
                                   this is the same as the return value of
                                   :meth:`derive`.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.InvalidKey: This is raised when the
                                                    derived key does not match
                                                    the expected key.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized: This is raised when
                                                          :meth:`derive` or

                                                          once.

        This checks whether deriving a new key from the supplied
        ``key_material`` generates the same key as the ``expected_key``, and
        raises an exception if they do not match. This can be used for
        checking whether the password a user provides matches the stored derived
        key.

        highly recommended. Ideally as many bits of entropy as the security
        level of the hash: often that means cryptographically random and as

        still meaningfully contribute to security. May be reused. Does not have
        to be secret, but may cause stronger security guarantees if secret; see
        :rfc:`5869` and the `HKDF paper`_ for more details. If ``None`` is

    Scrypt is a KDF designed for password storage by Colin Percival to be
    resistant against hardware-assisted attackers by having a tunable memory
    cost. It is described in :rfc:`7914`.

    This class conforms to the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.KeyDerivationFunction`
    interface.

    :param bytes salt: A salt.
    :param int length: The desired length of the derived key in bytes.

        power of 2.
    :param int r: Block size parameter.
    :param int p: Parallelization parameter.

    The computational and memory cost of Scrypt can be adjusted by manipulating
    the 3 parameters: ``n``, ``r``, and ``p``. In general, the memory cost of
    Scrypt is affected by the values of both ``n`` and ``r``, while ``n`` also
    determines the number of iterations performed. ``p`` increases the
    computational cost without affecting memory usage. A more in-depth
    explanation of the 3 parameters can be found `here`_.

    :rfc:`7914` `recommends`_ values of ``r=8`` and ``p=1`` while scaling ``n``
    to a number appropriate for your system. `The scrypt paper`_ suggests a
    minimum value of ``n=2**14`` for interactive logins (t < 100ms), or
    ``n=2**20`` for more sensitive files (t < 5s).

    .. method:: verify(key_material, expected_key)

        :param bytes key_material: The input key material. This is the same as
                                   ``key_material`` in :meth:`derive`.
        :param bytes expected_key: The expected result of deriving a new key,
                                   this is the same as the return value of
                                   :meth:`derive`.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.InvalidKey: This is raised when the
                                                    derived key does not match
                                                    the expected key.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized: This is raised when
                                                          :meth:`derive` or
                                                          :meth:`verify` is
                                                          called more than
                                                          once.

        This checks whether deriving a new key from the supplied
        ``key_material`` generates the same key as the ``expected_key``, and
        raises an exception if they do not match. This can be used for
        something like checking whether a user's password attempt matches the
        stored derived key.
