Currently this package contains a reference implementation for the
IETF Internet-Draft:
"XMSS: Extended Hash-Based Signatures"
draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-signatures-07
as of October 2016.

The reference implementation in this package was written by Stefan-Lukas Gazdag
and Denis Butin. It is a very basic implementation simply showing the internals
of XMSS and XMSS^MT as described by the Internet-Draft.

The code is available via www.pqsignatures.org

Tests can be found in xmss/test/

Running 'make' in the code directory builds the reference implementation.

A more practical and efficient implementation using more advanced algorithms was
published by Andreas Huelsing and Joost Rijneveld independently.
The code is available at www.huelsing.net

An easy to read Keccak implementation from the KeccakCodePackage
(https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage) was included to offer support
for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256. To switch between SHA2 and SHA3 please use the
"SHA" directive in <hash_draft.h>. For performance reasons one may want to use
an optimized implementation from that package.
