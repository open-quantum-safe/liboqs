/*
 * Custom floating-point implementation with integer arithmetics. We
 * use IEEE-754 "binary64" format, with some simplifications:
 *
 *   - Top bit is s = 1 for negative, 0 for positive.
 *
 *   - Exponent e uses the next 11 bits (bits 52 to 62, inclusive).
 *
 *   - Mantissa m uses the 52 low bits.
 *
 * Encoded value is, in general: (-1)^s * 2^(e-1023) * (1 + m*2^(-52))
 * i.e. the mantissa really is a 53-bit number (less than 2.0, but not
 * less than 1.0), but the top bit (equal to 1 by definition) is omitted
 * in the encoding.
 *
 * In IEEE-754, there are some special values:
 *
 *   - If e = 2047, then the value is either an infinite (m = 0) or
 *     a NaN (m != 0).
 *
 *   - If e = 0, then the value is either a zero (m = 0) or a subnormal,
 *     aka "denormalized number" (m != 0).
 *
 * Of these, we only need the zeros. The caller is responsible for not
 * providing operands that would lead to infinites, NaNs or subnormals.
 * If inputs are such that values go out of range, then indeterminate
 * values are returned (it would still be deterministic, but no specific
 * value may be relied upon).
 *
 * At the C level, the three parts are stored in a 64-bit unsigned
 * word.
 *
 * One may note that a property of the IEEE-754 format is that order
 * is preserved for positive values: if two positive floating-point
 * values x and y are such that x < y, then their respective encodings
 * as _signed_ 64-bit integers i64(x) and i64(y) will be such that
 * i64(x) < i64(y). For negative values, order is reversed: if x < 0,
 * y < 0, and x < y, then ia64(x) > ia64(y).
 *
 * IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS:
 * ======================
 *
 * For proper computations, and constant-time behaviour, we assume the
 * following:
 *
 *   - 32x32->64 multiplication (unsigned) has an execution time that
 *     is independent of its operands. This is true of most modern
 *     x86 and ARM cores. Notable exceptions are the ARM Cortex M0, M0+
 *     and M3 (in the M0 and M0+, this is done in software, so it depends
 *     on that routine), and the PowerPC cores from the G3/G4 lines.
 *     For more info, see: https://www.bearssl.org/ctmul.html
 *
 *   - Left-shifts and right-shifts of 32-bit values have an execution
 *     time which does not depend on the shifted value nor on the
 *     shift count. An historical exception is the Pentium IV, but most
 *     modern CPU have barrel shifters. Some small microcontrollers
 *     might have varying-time shifts (not the ARM Cortex M*, though).
 *
 *   - Right-shift of a signed negative value performs a sign extension.
 *     As per the C standard, this operation returns an
 *     implementation-defined result (this is NOT an "undefined
 *     behaviour"). On most/all systems, an arithmetic shift is
 *     performed, because this is what makes most sense.
 */

/*
 * Normally we should declare the 'fpr' type to be a struct or union
 * around the internal 64-bit value; however, we want to use the
 * direct 64-bit integer type to enable a lighter call convention on
 * ARM platforms. This means that direct (invalid) use of operators
 * such as '*' or '+' will not be caught by the compiler. We rely on
 * the "normal" (non-emulated) code to detect such instances.
 */
typedef uint64_t fpr;

 * For computations, we split values into an integral mantissa in the

 * "sticky" (it is set to 1 if any of the bits below it is 1); when
 * re-encoding, the low two bits are dropped, but may induce an
 * increment in the value for proper rounding.
 */

/*
 * Right-shift a 64-bit unsigned value by a possibly secret shift count.
 * We assumed that the underlying architecture had a barrel shifter for
