It has been reported that patent US7308097B2 may be applicable to parts
of Falcon. William Whyte, one of the designers of Falcon and also
representative of OnBoard Security (current owner of the said patent),
has pledged, as part of the IP statements submitted to the NIST for the
PQC project, that in the event of Falcon being selected for
standardization, a worldwide non-exclusive license to the patent will be
granted for the purpose of implementing the standard "without
compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination".
