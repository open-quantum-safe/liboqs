/*
 * IMPORTANT API RULES
 * -------------------
 *
 * This API has some non-trivial usage rules:
 *
 *
 *  - All public functions (i.e. the non-static ones) must be referenced
 *    with the PQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_ macro (e.g. PQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_verify_raw for the verify_raw()
 *    function). That macro adds a prefix to the name, which is
 *    configurable with the FALCON_PREFIX macro. This allows compiling
 *    the code into a specific "namespace" and potentially including
 *    several versions of this code into a single application (e.g. to
 *    have an AVX2 and a non-AVX2 variants and select the one to use at
 *    runtime based on availability of AVX2 opcodes).
 *
 *  - Functions that need temporary buffers expects them as a final
 *    tmp[] array of type uint8_t*, with a size which is documented for
 *    each function. However, most have some alignment requirements,
 *    because they will use the array to store 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit
 *    values (e.g. uint64_t or double). The caller must ensure proper
 *    alignment. What happens on unaligned access depends on the
 *    underlying architecture, ranging from a slight time penalty
 *    to immediate termination of the process.
 *
 *  - Some functions rely on specific rounding rules and precision for
 *    floating-point numbers. On some systems (in particular 32-bit x86
 *    with the 387 FPU), this requires setting an hardware control
 *    word. The caller MUST use set_fpu_cw() to ensure proper precision:
 *
 *      oldcw = set_fpu_cw(2);
 *      PQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_sign_dyn(...);
 *      set_fpu_cw(oldcw);
 *
 *    On systems where the native floating-point precision is already
 *    proper, or integer-based emulation is used, the set_fpu_cw()
 *    function does nothing, so it can be called systematically.
 */


#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>





/*
 * Some computations with floating-point elements, in particular
 * rounding to the nearest integer, rely on operations using _exactly_
 * the precision of IEEE-754 binary64 type (i.e. 52 bits). On 32-bit
 * x86, the 387 FPU may be used (depending on the target OS) and, in
 * that case, may use more precision bits (i.e. 64 bits, for an 80-bit
 * total type length); to prevent miscomputations, we define an explicit
 * function that modifies the precision in the FPU control word.
 *
 * set_fpu_cw() sets the precision to the provided value, and returns
 * the previously set precision; callers are supposed to restore the
 * previous precision on exit. The correct (52-bit) precision is
 * configured with the value "2". On unsupported compilers, or on
 * targets other than 32-bit x86, or when the native 'double' type is
 * not used, the set_fpu_cw() function does nothing at all.

/*
 * Encoding/decoding functions (codec.c).
 *
 * Encoding functions take as parameters an output buffer (out) with
 * a given maximum length (max_out_len); returned value is the actual
 * number of bytes which have been written. If the output buffer is
 * not large enough, then 0 is returned (some bytes may have been
 * written to the buffer). If 'out' is NULL, then 'max_out_len' is
 * ignored; instead, the function computes and returns the actual
 * required output length (in bytes).
 *
 * Decoding functions take as parameters an input buffer (in) with
 * its maximum length (max_in_len); returned value is the actual number
 * of bytes that have been read from the buffer. If the provided length
 * is too short, then 0 is returned.
 *
 * Values to encode or decode are vectors of integers, with N = 2^logn
 * elements.
 *
 * Three encoding formats are defined:
 *
 *   - modq: sequence of values modulo 12289, each encoded over exactly
 *     14 bits. The encoder and decoder verify that integers are within
 *     the valid range (0..12288). Values are arrays of uint16.
 *
 *   - trim: sequence of signed integers, a specified number of bits
 *     each. The number of bits is provided as parameter and includes
 *     the sign bit. Each integer x must be such that |x| < 2^(bits-1)
 *     (which means that the -2^(bits-1) value is forbidden); encode and
 *     decode functions check that property. Values are arrays of
 *     int16_t or int8_t, corresponding to names 'trim_i16' and
 *     'trim_i8', respectively.
 *
 *   - comp: variable-length encoding for signed integers; each integer
 *     uses a minimum of 9 bits, possibly more. This is normally used
 *     only for signatures.
