BIKE-1 - Additional implementation of "BIKE: Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation". 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is an "additional optimized" implementation of the Round-2 
variant of BIKE-1. 

BIKE is a submission to the Post-Quantum Cryptography 
Standardization project http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography.

The official BIKE website is: https://bikesuite.org

This package offers two constant time implementations of Round-2 BIKE-1.
- A portable implementation that requires libcrypto.a (e.g., of OpenSSL) for AES256 and SHA384.
- An x86_64 optimized implementation with AVX2 or AVX512.

The optimizations in this package are based on the paper: 
Nir Drucker, Shay Gueron, "A Toolbox for Software Optimization of QC-MDPC Code-Based Cryptosystems." 
Journal of Cryptographic Engineering, January 2019, 1â€“17 https://doi.org/10.1007/s13389-018-00200-4.

The decoder (in decoder/decoder.c) algorithm is the Black-Gray decoder included
in the early submission of CAKE (due to N. Sandrier and R. Misoczki).

The analysis for the constant time implementation is given in:
Nir Drucker, Shay Gueron, and Dusan Kostic, "On constant-time QC-MDPC decoding with negligible failure rate", ePrint, 2019.

The code is due to Nir Drucker, Shay Gueron (and Dusan Kostic for the Round-2 flows).
