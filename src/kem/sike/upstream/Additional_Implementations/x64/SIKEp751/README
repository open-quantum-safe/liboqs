Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation: SIKEp751
Optimized implementation for x64 platforms with x64 assembly
=======================================================================
    
Simply do:

$ make clean; make

And then execute the following to run the tests:

$ ./sike/test_KEM

Or execute the following to run the KATs:

$ ./sike/PQCtestKAT_kem

By default, MULX and ADX instructions are used, and compilation is performed with 
GNU GCC.


ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
------------------

make CC=[gcc/clang] SET=EXTENDED USE_MULX=[TRUE/FALSE] USE_ADX=[TRUE/FALSE]

Setting "SET=EXTENDED" adds the flags -fwrapv -fomit-frame-pointer -march=native.
The use of mulx and adx instructions is included by default. The user is responsible 
for checking if these instructions are supported in the targeted platform and then 
setting the corresponding flags above accordingly.

Note: USE_ADX can only be set to TRUE if USE_MULX=TRUE.
