This is a reference implementation of NTRU LPrime 4591^761. This
implementation is designed primarily for clarity, subject to the
following constraints:

   * The implementation is written in C. We have a separate Sage
     implementation that is considerably more concise.

   * The implementation avoids data-dependent branches and array
     indices. For example, conditional swaps are computed by arithmetic
     rather than by branches.

   * The implementation avoids other C operations that often take
     variable time. For example, divisions by 3 are computed via
     multiplications and shifts.
     
This implementation does _not_ sacrifice clarity for speed.

This implementation has not yet been reviewed for correctness or for
constant-time behavior. It does pass various tests and has no known
bugs, but there are at least some platforms where multiplications take
variable time, and fixing this requires platform-specific effort; see
https://www.bearssl.org/ctmul.html and http://repository.tue.nl/800603.

This implementation allows "benign malleability" of ciphertexts, as
defined in http://www.shoup.net/papers/iso-1_1.pdf. A similar comment
applies to public keys.
