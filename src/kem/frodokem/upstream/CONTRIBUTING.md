# Instructions for Contributing Code

## Contributing bug fixes and features
SIDH is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes and new features. Any submission must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved by the SIDH team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

## Legal
