/*
 * This is the routine that generates the ephemeral ("working") key from the
 * short private value.  It builds all the various current, building and
 * next subtrees for the various levels (to at least the extent required
 * for the current count within the key).
 *
 * The code is made considerably more complex because we try to take
 * advantage of parallelism.  To do this, we explicitly list the parts
 * of the subtrees we need to build (which is most of the computation), and
 * have different worker threads build the various parts,
 *
 * However, it turns out that this is sometimes insufficient; sometimes,
 * the work consists of one or two expensive nodes (perhaps the top level
 * subtree), and a lot of comparatively cheap ones; in this case, we'd have
 * most of our threads go through the cheap ones quickly, and have one or
 * two threads working on the expensive one, and everyone will end up waiting
 * for that.  To mitigate that, we attempt to subdivide the most expensive
 * requests; instead of having a single thread computing the expensive node,
 * we may issue four or eight threads to compute the nodes two or three
 * levels below (and have the main thread do the final computation when
 * all the threads are completed).
 *
 * This works out pretty good; however man does add complexity :-(
