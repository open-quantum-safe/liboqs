 * These are the functions to sign a message incrementally.
 * That is, we assume that we don't have the entire message at
 * once, instead, we have it in pieces (for example, the signature
 * is of a multigigabyte file)
 *
 * Usage:
 *    struct hss_sign_inc ctx;
 *    bool success = hss_sign_init( &ctx, working_key,
 *            update_private_key, private_key_context,
 *            signature, signature_buffer_len,
 *            &lsat_signature );
 *    hss_sign_update( &ctx, message_part_1, len_1 );
 *    hss_sign_update( &ctx, message_part_2, len_2 );
 *    hss_sign_update( &ctx, message_part_3, len_3 );
 *    success = hss_sign_finalize( &ctx, working_key, signature );
 *    if (success) printf( "We generated the signature\n" );
 *
 * This is in its own include file because we need to import some
 * 'not-generally-for-general-consumption' include files to make
 * it work (as they're in the hss_sign_inc structure)

 * This is the context structure that holds the intermedate results of an

 * It's a application-visible structure for ease of use: the application can

 * signing, it doesn't cause a memory leak
