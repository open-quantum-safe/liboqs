/*
 * This is the file that contains the routines that generate various 'random'
 * values from the master seed.
 *
 * Values generated by this routine:
 * - OTS private keys
 * - Message randomizers (the random value we hash with the message when we
 *   sign it)
 * - I values
 * - SEED values (which are the secret to derive all the above for a specific
 *   LMS tree)
 *
 * We do things determanisticly, rather than picking things from random, so
 * that if we reload from scratch, the values we use after the reload are
 * consistent with what we used previously
 *
 * This provides several different possible derivation methods; they can be
 * selected by setting SECRET_METHOD in config.h
