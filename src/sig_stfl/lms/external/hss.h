/*
 * This is intended to be a usable (nontoy) implementation of the LMS
 * signature scheme.  The public data (public keys, signatures) are
 * precisely the same as the standard LMS implmentation; however it
 * strives to be more usable, in the following ways:
 *
 * - During signature generation time, it incrementally computes the next
 *   trees; that means that it doesn't need to generate the next Merkle tree
 *   from scratch on the 1025th signature.
 * - It doesn't try to hold the entire Merkle tree in memory; hence a level
 *   25 Merkle tree doesn't need to save 2**25 internal node values.  This
 *   does increase the time to generate the next siganture (as we will need
 *   to recompute some internal nodes); however by only a small constant factor
 * - It divides the private key into three parts, only one of which needs to
 *   be kept secret, and updated dynamically; the other parts are a working
 *   copy (that can be kept in RAM, and can be dynamically regenerated as
 *   needed), and some optional static (nonprivate) data (which can speed up
 *   the regeneration process)
 * - API to explicitly reserve the next N signatures (so that we don't need
 *   to update the secure storage copy quite as often)
 *
 *
 * We use a nonflat memory structure for the working_key.  Part of the reason
 * we use a flat representation elsewhere is so that they can be written (and
 * later read) to/from disk as required; we specifically assume that the
 * working_key is never written to disk. And, being able to use C structures
 * makes this rather nontrivial structure a bit more transparent
 *
 * Here is the intended order of usage:
 * Step 1: generate the private/public keypair:
 *   The API to do this is hss_generate_private_key; this is done once per
 *   private key; and you should write the private key to secure storage
 *   (which the passed update_private_key function could do)
 *
 * Step 2: (which you can do per restart):
 *   Load the private keypair into memory: hss_load_private_key
 *
 * Step 3: generate signatures (which you can do lots of time after you've
 *      loaded the key into memory):
 *   The API to do this is hss_generate_signature.  Note that this needs
 *   to update the private key state; the update_private_key function pointer
 *   can be useful here
 *
 * Step 4: (when you're done with the loaded private key; optional)
 *   Free the ephemeral copy (hss_free_working_key).  Note that this is not
 *   required for correctness; this just does a free()
 *
 *
 * One can also verify signatures at any time; all that needs is a public
 * key, a signature and a message; it's not a part of the intended order
 * of usage

/*
 * This will generate a fresh (unadorned) private key, with the selected
 * parameter set, the corresponding public key, and (optionally) the aux_data
 * that is associated with the private key.
 *
 * The generate_random function will be called when this function needs
 * random values; it is assumed to generate cryptographically secure ones.
 * We ask you to pass a function, rather than an array of random values,
 * to emphasize that we really do need fresh random data here; the security
 * of this entire system depends on it.
 *
 * levels, lm_type, lm_ots_type is the parameter set for the new key.
 * levels is the number of levels in the HSS hierarchy (1-8), while
 * lm_type[], lm_ots_type[] are arrays giving the parameter set of each
 * individual level; level i of the hierarchy will have LMS parameter set
 * lm_type[i] and OTS parameter set lm_ots_type[i] (where i=0 is the topmost
 * Merkle tree.
 *
 * The update_private_key function will be called when the private key is
 * generated; it is expected to write the private key to secure storage (and
 * the context pointer is a value that is passed to the update_private_key
 * function; it can be used to tell the update_private_key function where
 * in the secure storage to place the key).  If the passed update_private_key
 * function pointer is NULL, the private will will be written to the context
 * pointer (which is expected to hold 48 bytes of data)
 *
 * public_key is where the freshly generated public key will be placed, and
 * len_public_key is the size of the array (and this will generate an error
 * if the public key is larger than the array).  See the hss_get_public_key_len
 * function for the expected length of the public key
 *
 * aux_data is where to place internal nodes of the Merkle tree, and
 * len_aux_data is the length of the provided buffer.  This aux_data
 * is optional (pass in a NULL if it's not being used), but does significantly
 * speed the generate_working_key process.  It's envisioned use is to write
 * this aux_data to disk, and reread it when it's time to regenerate the
 * ephemeral key; it need not be kept in secure storage; revealing it doesn't
 * help an attacker to generate forgeries, and if an attacker does manage to
 * corrupt it, the regeneration process will detect the corruption and ignore
 * it.  Also, even if writing it to disk is not possible, passing in a
 * small array here and passing that to the initial regeneration call will
 * speed that up (and later ones can omit it; those will go slow, but at
 * least you got the speed up benefit the first time).
 *
 * One slightly tricky thing about aux data is that the required length of the
 * aux data; there are several different possible time/memory trade-offs.
 * Depending on the length, we'll automatically pick the fastest option that
 * fits. If we have N bytes available total, see hss_get_aux_data_len for
 * the amount of data we'll actually use (and so the amount you need to write
 * to disk)
