 * These are the functions to validate a signature incrementally.
 * That is, we assume that we don't have the entire message at
 * once, instead, we have it in pieces (for example, the signature
 * is of a multigigabyte file)
 *
 * Usage:
 *    struct hss_validate_inc ctx;
 *    bool success = hss_validate_init( &ctx, public_key, signature );
 *    hss_validate_update( &ctx, message_part_1, len_1 );
 *    hss_validate_update( &ctx, message_part_2, len_2 );
 *    hss_validate_update( &ctx, message_part_3, len_3 );
 *    success = hss_validate_finalize( &ctx, signature );
 *    if (success) printf( "The signature validated\n" );
 *
 * This is in its own include file because we need to import some
 * 'not-generally-for-general-consumption' include files to make
 * it work (as they're in the hss_validate_inc structure)
