liboqs - master branch
======================

liboqs is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  This branch of liboqs focuses on selected key encapsulations and signature algorithms.

Overview
--------

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs provides:

- a common API for post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signature schemes
- a collection of open source implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms
- a test harness and benchmarking routines

The OQS project also provides prototype integrations into application-level protocols to enable testing of quantum-resistant cryptography.  

More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).

master branch
-------------

This branch of liboqs aims to selectively incorporate allegedly quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms and signature schemes, for the purposes of integration into a common API for liboqs-reliant applications.

Implementations on this branch must meet certain acceptance criteria as indicated below.

For a list of algorithms included in master branch, see the datasheets in [docs/algorithms](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/master/docs/algorithms).

Limitations and security
------------------------

liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography.  Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical or quantum computers.  

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms.  liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.  

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project.  We strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.

liboqs is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.  See [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for the full disclaimer.

Acceptance criteria for master branch
-------------------------------------

New submissions to master branch must meet the following acceptance criteria:

- **Algorithmic requirements:**
	- The algorithm must be submitted to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography project, or posted as update to an existing algorithm, and must be present in the current round
	- Algorithms whose security is considered effectively broken are not eligible for addition; see the Lifecycle section below for conditions on their removal.
	- KEMs can be IND-CPA or IND-CCA-secure, at any NIST security level.
	- Signature schemes can be EUF-CMA-secure, at any NIST security level.
- **Targets**:
	- **Operating systems:** The code must build on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
	- **Architecture:** The code must build at least on x86 and x64.  Build targets are available for various processor-specific features.
- **Source code requirements:**
	- **License:** Source code licensed under the MIT License, the BSD license, or in the public domain can be directly incorporated into the repository.  GPL code will not be included in the repository.
	- **Code quality:** The source code must meet the following quality checks, some of which are enforced by our continuous integration system:
		- Public API functions must be documented with appropriate Doxygen comments.
		- Source code must be formatted in accordance with our formatting requirements (`make prettyprint`).
		- All secrets in memory must be zero'ed out before being deallocated/released using our `OQS_MEM_*` functions.
		- Exported symbols must be namespaced.
		- We will periodically run static analysis other analysis tools to identify additional potential flaws.
	- **Common function usage:** The source code should make use of liboqs' random number generator, AES implementation, and SHA-3 implementation, rather than its own implementation.
- **Maintenance**: We hope the contributor will intend to help update the implementation in liboqs as the algorithm evolves or as we make enhancements to the library.

Algorithms may be removed from liboqs master branch if they no longer meet the acceptance criteria, see the lifecycle section below.

Contributing
------------

Contributions that meet the acceptance criteria above are gratefully welcomed.  See <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> for details on contributing an implementation.

Lifecycle for master branch
---------------------------

**Release cycle:** We aim to make releases of liboqs master branch every 2 to 3 months.  Plans for each individual release can be found on our [Github projects board](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/).  We will use semantic versioning ($X.Y.Z$) as described below.

**Algorithm deprecation:** If an algorithm in master branch is found to be insecure or does not advance to the next round of the NIST competition, but is included in version $X.Y.Z$, it will be marked as deprecated using a compile time warning in version $X.(Y+1).Z$ and removed in version $X.(Y+2).Z$.

**Algorithm compatibility:** Unlike existing standardization cryptographic algorithms (SHA-2, SHA-3, PKCS\#1v1.5, nistp256, ...), post-quantum algorithms are under active development, and the mathematical algorithm of a cryptographic scheme may change: a particular name (e.g., "FrodoKEM-AES-640") may refer to different mathematical algorithms over time.  liboqs may update implementations as algorithms evolve.  Using our semantic versioning, versions with the same first two components ($X.Y.*$) will be interoperable.  But version $X.Y.Z$ and version $X.(Y+1).Z'$ may not be interoperable.  liboqs-reliant applications can check the `alg_version` member of the `OQS_KEM` data structure for each algorithm to obtain an identifier of the algorithm version used in a particular implementation; implementations returning the same `alg_version` for an algorithm will be interoperable.

**API stability:** The public API of liboqs master branch is currently considered to be the functions in `oqs/common.h`, `oqs/config.h`, `oqs/kem.h`, and `oqs/rand.h`.  Incompatible changes to the public API will lead to incrementing $X$ in version $X.Y.Z$. (`oqs/sig.h` will eventually be part of the public API, but is currently under development, and no promises are made about its API stability at present.)

Some aspects of liboqs master branch are currently in transition:

- All key exchange (KEX) algorithms will be removed; some will be replaced with key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), others will not be replaced.
- The signature API will be modified to be closer to the API used on liboqs nist-branch

Building and running liboqs master branch
-----------------------------------------

Builds are tested using the Travis continuous integration system on macOS 10.13.3 (clang 9.1.0) and Ubuntu 14.04.5 (gcc.4.8, gcc-4.9, gcc-5, gcc-6).

- [Build status using Travis continuous integration system:](https://travis-ci.org/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/branches) ![Build status image](https://travis-ci.org/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.svg?branch=master)

### Install dependencies for Linux Ubuntu

You need to install the following packages:

	sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool gcc libssl-dev unzip xsltproc

### Install dependencies for macOS

You need to install the following packages using brew (or a package manager of your choice):

	brew install autoconf automake libtool openssl wget

### Building

To build, first clone or download the source from GitHub:

	git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
	cd liboqs
	git checkout master
	make

Run the build system:

	autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make clean
	make

(If on macOS you encounter an error like `Can't exec "libtoolize": No such file or directory at ...`, try running with `LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize autoreconf -i`.)

You can enable/disable various algorithms at compile-time, tell liboqs to use OpenSSL for certain crypto algorithms, and more; see `./configure --help`.  (In particular, on macOS, you might want to point liboqs to brew's version of OpenSSL, via the command: `./configure --enable-openssl --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl`.)

### Build results

The main build result is `liboqs.a`, a static library.  (This may be placed in the `.libs` directory.)

There are also a variety of test programs built under the `tests` directory:

- `test_kem`: Simple test harness for all enabled key encapsulation mechanisms
- `test_kem`: Simple test harness for all enabled key exchange algorithms
- `test_sig`: Simple test harness for all enabled key signature schemes
- `kat_kem`: Program that generates known answer test (KAT) values for all enabled key encapsulation mechanisms using the same mechanism as the NIST submission requirements, for checking against submitted KAT values
- `speed_kem`: Benchmarking program for key encapsulation mechanisms; see `./speed_kem --help` for usage instructions
- `example_kem`: Minimal runnable example showing the usage of the KEM API
- `minimal_kex_oqs`: Minimal runnable example showing the usage of the kex exchange API (to be removed)
- `minimal_sig_oqs`: Minimal runnable example showing the usage of the signature API (to be removed and replaced by `example_sig`)
- `test_aes`, `test_rand`, `test_sha3`: Simple test harnesses for crypto sub-components

#### Memory benchmarks

To run one or more ciphers only once use `--mem-bench`, which is suitable for memory usage profiling:

	tests/test_kex --mem-bench ntru

You may also get instant memory usage results of an algorithm (e.g. ntru) by running [valgrind's massif tool](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html) by running

	./kex_bench_memory.sh ntru

Building and running on Windows
-------------------------------

Windows binaries can be generated using the Visual Studio solution in the `VisualStudio` folder.

Builds are tested using the Appveyor continuous integration system on Windows Server 2016 (Visual Studio 2017).  Our developers also test builds periodically on Windows 10.

- [Build status using Appveyor continuous integration system:](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dstebila/liboqs) ![Build status image](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9d2ts78x88r8wnii/branch/master?svg=true)

The supported schemes are defined in the projects' `winconfig.h` file.

McBits is disabled by default in the Visual Studio build; follow these steps to enable it:

- Obtain the [libsodium library](https://libsodium.org); compile the static library from the Visual Studio projects.
- Add `ENABLE_CODE_MCBITS` and `SODIUM_STATIC` to the preprocessor definitions of the `oqs` and `test_kex` projects.
- Add the sodium "src/include" location to the "Additional Include Directories" in the oqs project C properties.
- Add the libsodium library to the "Additional Dependencies" in the `test_kex` project Linker properties.
