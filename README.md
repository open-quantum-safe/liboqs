liboqs - nist-branch
====================

liboqs is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  This branch of liboqs focuses on incorporating submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project.

Overview
--------

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs provides:

- a common API for post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signature schemes
- a collection of open source implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms
- a test harness and benchmarking routines

The OQS project also provides prototype integrations into application-level protocols to enable testing of quantum-resistant cryptography.  

More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).

nist-branch
-----------

This branch of liboqs aims to non-selectively incorporate submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography project for the purposes of benchmarking and integration into a common API for liboqs-reliant applications.  

This branch takes a "light touch" approach to incorporation:

- Source code from a NIST submission will be included ideally with no changes, in an "upstream" subdirectory.
- A thin wrapper will be written to provide the implementation using the liboqs API.
- The implementation will be added to the build process.
- To avoid namespace collisions between different algorithms, symbol renaming will be used on the compiled files.

For a list of algorithms included in nist-branch, see the datasheets in [docs/algorithms](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/nist-branch/docs/algorithms).

Limitations and security
------------------------

liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography.  Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical or quantum computers.  

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms.  liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.  

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project.  We strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.

liboqs is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.  See [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/nist-branch/LICENSE.txt) for the full disclaimer.

In addition, implementations that we have included on this nist-branch of liboqs have received no quality control or vetting by OQS.  **THE NIST-BRANCH OF LIBOQS SHOULD BE USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND PROTOTYPING, AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED IN ANY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT OR TO PROTECT ANY SENSITIVE DATA.**

Acceptance criteria for nist-branch
-----------------------------------

- **Algorithmic requirements:**
	- Any algorithm accepted as a full and complete submission to round 1 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography project is eligible for inclusion.
	- Algorithms whose security is considered effectively broken are not eligible for addition; see the Lifecycle section below for conditions on their removal.
	- KEMs can be IND-CPA or IND-CCA-secure, at any NIST security level.
	- Signature schemes can be EUF-CMA-secure, at any NIST security level.
- **Targets**:
	- **Operating systems:** The code must build on Linux and macOS.
	- **Architecture:** The code must build at least on x64.  Targets are currently provided for x86.  We plan to add an AVX2 target, and possibly others.
- **Source code requirements:**
	- The source code can be from the original submission, or can be an updated version.
	- **License:** Source code licensed under the MIT License, the BSD license, or in the public domain can be directly incorporated into the repository.  GPL code will not be included in the repository, but a wrapper to the OQS API may be included, as well as a script that downloads and compiles in GPL code if the algorithm is requested at compile-time.
	- **Code quality:** Given the "light touch" philosophy of nist-branch, we have no requirements on source code quality, other than that it compile on the targets.

Contributing
------------

Contributions that meet the acceptance criteria above are gratefully welcomed.  See <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/nist-branch/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> for details on contributing an implementation.

Lifecycle for nist-branch
-------------------------

**Release cycle:** We aim to tag monthly snapshot of nist-branch, released around the end of each month.  Plans for each individual snapshot release can be found on our [Github projects board](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/).

**Algorithm deprecation:** If an algorithm in nist-branch is found to be insecure in month $X$, a compile-time warning will be added in the tagged snapshot for month $X+1$, and it may be removed in month $X+2$.

**Algorithm compatibility:** Algorithm implementations on nist-branch may be updated at any time.  This may cause changes in runtime or even a change in the message generation and processing.  Thus, no guarantees are made for compatibility of messages exchange between different snapshots of nist-branch.

**API stability:** The public API of liboqs nist-branch is considered to be the functions in `oqs/common.h`, `oqs/config.h`, `oqs/kem.h`, and `oqs/rand.h`.  For the first few snapshot releases of nist-branch, this API should be considered in draft.

**Binary compatibility:** No guarantees are made for binary compatibility between different snapshots of nist-branch.

Building and running liboqs nist-branch
---------------------------------------

[Build status using Travis continuous integration system:](https://travis-ci.org/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/branches) ![Build status image](https://travis-ci.org/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.svg?branch=nist-branch)

Builds have been tested on macOS 10.12.6 (clang), macOS 10.13.3 (clang), Ubuntu 14.04.5 (gcc-7).

### Install dependencies for Linux (Ubuntu)

You need to install the following packages:

	sudo apt install gcc libssl-dev

### Install dependencies for macOS

You need to install the following packages using brew (or a package manager of your choice):

	brew install openssl

### Building

To build, first clone or download the source from GitHub, then run Make.

	git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
	cd liboqs
	git checkout nist-branch
	make

If you wish to change the target architecture or disable certain algorithms, edit the first few lines of `Makefile`, then run:

	make clean
	make

This will generate:

- `liboqs.a`: Static library
- `liboqs.so`: Shared library
- `test_kem`: Simple test harness for all enabled key encapsulation mechanisms
- `kat_kem`: Program that generates known answer test (KAT) values for all enabled key encapsulation mechanisms using the same mechanism as the NIST submission requirements, for checking against submitted KAT values
- `speed_kem`: Benchmarking program for key encapsulation mechanisms; see `./speed_kem --help` for usage instructions
- `example_kem`: Minimal runnable example showing the usage of the KEM API

Documentation
-------------

The directory `docs/algorithms` contains information about each algorithm available in this branch of liboqs.

If you have Doxygen installed (Linux: `sudo apt install doxygen graphviz`; macOS: `brew install doxygen graphviz`), you can build HTML documentation of the liboqs nist-branch API:

	make docs

Then open `docs/doxygen/html/index.html` in your web browser.
