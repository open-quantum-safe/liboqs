# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_X86_CPU_SUPPORTS(X86-INSTRUCTION-SET,
#     [ACTION-IF-FOUND],[ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Checks if the host cpu supports X86-INSTRUCTION-SET. The instruction set
#   that can be tested are "mmx, popcnt, sse, sse2, sse3, sse4.1, sse4.2,
#   sse4a, avx, avx2, avx512f, fma, fma4, bmi, bmi2". If the instruction set
#   is supported by the host cpu, the C preprocessor macro
#   USE_XXX_INSTRUCTIONS is set to 1. The XXX is up-cased instruction case
#   with dot replaced by underscore. For example, the test for "sse4.2"
#   would export USE_SSE4_2_INSTRUCTIONS=1. This macro requires gcc
#   extended builtin function "__builtin_cpu_supports" to detect the cpu features.
#
#   If the test for the instruction set succeeded, the hook ACTION-IF-FOUND
#   would run. Otherwise the hook ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND would run if
#   specified.
#
#   See also AX_CHECK_X86_FEATURES, which checks all the possible
#   instruction set and export the corresponding CFLAGS.
