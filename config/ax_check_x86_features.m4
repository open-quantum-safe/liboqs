# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_X86_FEATURES([ACTION-IF-FOUND],[ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Checks if the host cpu supports various x86 instruction set, the
#   instructions that will get tested are "mmx, popcnt, sse, sse2, sse3,
#   sse4.1, sse4.2, sse4a, avx, avx2, avx512f, fma, fma4, bmi, bmi2". If the
#   instruction set is supported by the host cpu, the C preprocessor macro
#   HAVE_XXX_INSTRUCTIONS is set to 1. The XXX is up-cased instruction case
#   with dot replaced by underscore. For example, the test for "sse4.2"
#   would export HAVE_SSE4_2_INSTRUCTIONS=1. Also the compiler flag
#   "-msse4.2" would be added to X86_FEATURE_CFLAGS variable, that can be
#   obtained in Makefile.am using @X86_FEATURE_CFLAGS@.
#
#   If any of the test for the instruction set were succeeded, the configure
#   script would run ACTION-IF-FOUND if it is specified, or append
#   X86_FEATURE_CFLAGS to CFLAGS. If none of the instruction were found,
#   ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND hook is triggered.
#
#   This macro requires gcc extended builtin function "__builtin_cpu_init"
#   and "__builtin_cpu_supports" to detect the cpu features. It will error
#   out if the compiler doesn't has these builtins.
#
#   See also AX_GCC_X86_CPU_SUPPORTS, which is the actual macro that perform
#   the checks for the instruction sets.
